Thanks in advance for evaluating my submission. To start, I put this together in Node rather than Python for expediency: I've worked in production Node environments, and although I do have a few years aggregate experience in Django applications, I'm less confident in my ability to demonstrate basic code hygiene in that ecosystem.

To that end, I tried to demonstrate some good practices that are a bit overengineered for the complexity of this problem.
